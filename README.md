# Project Symbol Explorer

**Project Symbol Explorer** is a Visual Studio Code extension that scans your entire workspace for all symbols—such as classes, types, functions, and variables—using the VS Code symbol provider APIs. It then displays these symbols in an interactive webview panel, allowing you to visually explore the structure of your project.

- Works best with TypeScript and JavaScript projects.
- Can be extended to support other languages that provide symbol information through VS Code.
- Uses the latest VS Code APIs for symbol discovery and visualization.

2. Run `Project Symbol Explorer: Hello World` or `Project Symbol Explorer: Toggle Project Symbol Explorer`.
3. View all project symbols in the panel.
